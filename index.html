    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>The story of constellations dates back thousands of years to various ancient civilizations. These celestial
      patterns in the night sky served as a means of navigation, storytelling, and cultural significance. Early
      cultures, such as the Mesopotamians and Egyptians, began connecting the dots in the stars to form shapes that
      represented their myths, legends, and gods. In this way, constellations played a vital role in their religious
      beliefs and agricultural calendars.</p>

    </div>
    <p>As time passed, different cultures around the world developed their own constellations, often with unique stories
      and interpretations. The ancient Greeks, for instance, contributed significantly to the Western understanding of
      constellations, providing us with names and stories that have endured to this day, such as the hero Perseus and
      the mythological characters like Orion and Cassiopeia. Over time, the study of constellations evolved into the
      science of astronomy, with the International Astronomical Union officially defining 88 modern constellations,
      preserving the rich historical and cultural tapestry of these celestial patterns.</p>
